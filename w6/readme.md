# Task

Develop two devices using STM32F4 DISCOVERY boards:

- One representing a light bulb (ZC)
- One representing a remote controller (ZED or ZR)

Remote controller has two buttons:

- One of them triggers a toggle action
- The other one triggers a step up function (“wrapping” to zero)
- Pressing both buttons at the same time forces the light bulb to change color   

Document API for light bulb control protocol.
