# Task: protocol

The protocol support the following commands:
* Enabling/disabling a light bulb
* Toggling a light bulb
* Brightness: step up, step down, set to level
* Toggle the color (weâ€™ll assume that the bulb has a predetermined set of colors)
* Used APS payload only, not clusters, endpoints, etc.
* Optimized payload size: not used more bytes than a specific command really needs
